# Login Template

A simple **free to use** login template made using html,css and js.

# Setup

\- First of all download this project and unzip it <br/>
\- You can customize anything if you want to <br/>
\- Then go to the **/assets/js/** folder. These are template javascript files. You would want to set up your authentification system in them. If you dont know how to set up authentification I reccomend using **FireBase Authentification**. <br/>
\- And last but not least I reccomend putting some time and efford into security. The "done.html" page representing content for the authenticated users **can be easily accessible by editing the page url**. <br/>

## Including

\- When you unzip the downloaded project files you will see: <br/>
